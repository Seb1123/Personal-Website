    <h3>August 16, 2023</h3>
    <p>No recipe today. Just trying to get the dishes down for my station.<br>
        I ventured out into the dining area after my shift and was struck by how pretty it looked. Here is the view.

    <p>The picture does not do it justice.<br>
        Through the large window panes in the background, you can see the whole splendor of the Brooklyn bridge firmly connecting the signature array of lights typically depicted in portrayals of NYC.<br>
        In other words, it looks as if you're dining in a painting. How did I get here? Luck. How do I stay here? Work hard and be of value. I still have a lot to learn.
