        <h3>August 4, 2023</h3>
        <p>What a day. Another shift at The Fulton and I got to make some dishes for chef Jean-Georges' table.<br>
            I'm learning a lot and I'm very excited about going to work. Today chef went over knife <br>
            techniques that were very helpful: when cutting, it is really more about your hand (the claw) <br>
            being the main player than it is your knife. This was actually super insighful and I could tell <br>
            the difference it made in my cuts immediately. If you think about it, it makes a lot of sense. <br>
            Like cutting grass, or having a brain, you're the one in charge of the machine not the other way around.</p>

        <p>Here is a picture of the Watermelon Salad from work:</p>

        <p>For now, I need to prioritize memorizing the recipes of the dishes at my station.<br>
            I also have to practice my knife cuts. There is a lot to learn! :)</p>
