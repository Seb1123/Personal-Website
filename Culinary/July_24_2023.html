        <h3>July 24, 2023</h3>
        <p>Today, for lunch:</p>
        <img src="../images/Culinary/July 24, 2023/Salad_Presentation2.jpg"/>
        <p>Nice and refreshing <strong><em>Shaved Fennel and Radishes</em></strong> salad with <em><strong>Lemon Vinaigrette</em></strong>.
        <br> It's a simple recipe and the vinaigrette is very good. Here is the process:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Start by slicing Fennel</li>
            <img src="../images/Culinary/July 24, 2023/Fennel_Slicing.jpg"/>

            <li>Next, slice radishes and parsley and that's the base of the salad. Easy!</li>

            <li>After making the base we move onto making the Vinaigrette.
                <br>Lemon juice, lemon zest, garlic, white wine vinegar, and extra-virgin olive oil
            </li>

            <p>I forgot to take more photos of the Vinaigrette process, sorry.<br>
                But it was very satisfying to fully exhausted half of a lemon</p>
            <img src="../images/Culinary/July 24, 2023/Lemon_Exhaust.jpg"/>

            <li>Lastly, we put it altogether</li>
            <img src="../images/Culinary/July 24, 2023/Salad_Presentation3.jpg"/>
        </ol>
        <p>I'm very surprised by how tasteful the Vinaigrette was. I'll definitely be making more in the future.</p>
