        <p>So this is what I had for lunch:</p>

        <p>And <em>again</em> for dinner:</p>

        <p><strong><em>Chicken Teriyaki!</strong> (with some slaw on the side)</em></p>
        <p>Making it is pretty straight-forward. Here is how I did it:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>First, I let the chicken tenderloins sit out and dry:</li>

            <li>While waiting for the tenderloins to dry, I prep the rice:</li>

            <p>I like adding a pinch or two of salt and about a Tablespoon of Olive Oil (this is 2 cups of rice).</p>

            <li>Now I make the salad while the rice is cooking and the tenderloins are drying. <br>This is a recipe for Slaw taken from "Salt Fat Acid Heat" by Samin Nosrat.</li>

            <li>Once the tenderloins are dry and ready we go ahead cook them using Olive Oil under medium-low heat:</li>

            <li>And once the tenderloins are done, it all comes together likeso:</li>

            <p>It's only missing one final touch...</p>

            <p><strong><em>There we go...</em></strong></p>
        </ol>
