        <h3>July 25, 2023</h3>
        <p>Today for lunch:</p>
        <img src="../../../../images/Culinary/July 25, 2023/Plate2.jpg"/>
        <p><em><strong>Pasta alle Vongole</strong> (Pasta with clams)</em></p>
        <p>This is the most challenging plate I've done yet!</p>

        <ol>
            <li>We set up the ingredients:</li>
            <img src="../../../../images/Culinary/July 25, 2023/SetUp.jpg">

            <li>Coat the bottom of the pan with olive oil. Place the root ends of the onion,<br>
                  some parsley sprigs, and the clams into the pan and crank the heat to high.
            </li>
            <img src="../../../../images/Culinary/July 25, 2023/LittleNeck_Closed.jpg">
            <p>Pour a cup of white wine into the pan and let it steam for 6 minutes.</p>
            <img src="../../../../images/Culinary/July 25, 2023/LittleNeck_Steaming.jpg">
            <p>After 6 minutes</p>
            <img src="../../../../images/Culinary/July 25, 2023/LittleNeck_Open2.jpg">
            <p>There was an unopened clam which was still unopened after cooking for 3 more minutes than the rest.</p>
            <img src="../../../../images/Culinary/July 25, 2023/Unopen_Clam.jpg">
            <p>I was adviced to throw it away if it did not open after cooking for 6 minutes but I opened it...</p>
            <img src="../../../../images/Culinary/July 25, 2023/Unopen_Clam2.jpg">
            <p>It looked fine! Fits in with the others, you can't even tell it apart.</p>
            <img src="../../../../images/Culinary/July 25, 2023/Unopen_Clam3.jpg">
            <p>So now remove the meat from the clam</p>
            <img src="../../../../images/Culinary/July 25, 2023/LittleNeck_Meat.jpg">
            <p>And chop it up for later</p>
            <img src="../../../../images/Culinary/July 25, 2023/LittleNeck_Chopped.jpg">
            <p>Let the clam meat sit in its cooking liquid until later use</p>
            <img src="../../../../images/Culinary/July 25, 2023/Clam_Meat_Marinate.jpg">

            <li>Next, cook the diced onion until tender (12 minutes) and then add the minced garlic,<br>
                dry red pepper, previous cooking liquid and Manila clams.
            </li>
            <img src="../../../../images/Culinary/July 25, 2023/Manila_Clams.jpg">
            <p>Let them steam until they open</p>
            <img src="../../../../images/Culinary/July 25, 2023/ManilaClams_Steam.jpg">
            
            <li>Meanwhile, cook the pasta</li>
            <img src="../../../../images/Culinary/July 25, 2023/Linguine_Pasta.jpg">

            <li>Now the Manila clams have opened</li>
            <img src="../../../../images/Culinary/July 25, 2023/Manila_Clams_Open.jpg">
            <p>Next, immediately strain the pasta and let it finish cooking in the pan with the clams.<br>
                Also pour the chopped Little Neck clams, 4 tablespoons of buter and let it all cook together.</p>

            <li>Lastly, put it on a plate and sprinkle chopped parsley and parmesan cheese.</li>

            <p>I accompanied the dish with a side of yesterday's salad and vinaigrette</p>

            <p>It was delicious!</p>
