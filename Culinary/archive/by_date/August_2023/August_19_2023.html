    <h3>August 19, 2023</h3>
    <p>Today I woke up earlier than usual to get to the Farmer's Market at Union Square Park.</p>
    <img src="../../../../images/Culinary/August 19, 2023/UnionFarmersMarket.jpg">
    <p>Then I met up with Chef Lei, V, and Neel and we bought some produce and got to meet some farmers. <br>
        Chef spoke about how the produce you find in the regular supermarkets are somewhat tampered <br>
        in many ways that jeapordize their authentic flavor. It was eye-opening.
