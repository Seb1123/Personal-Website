        <p>I ran out of time to make a dish today but I practiced my cuts instead.<br>
            There are two specific cuts I need to improve on for work: Oblique cuts on carrots and Brunoise on shallots.<br>
            It's also important that I learn to do these tasks fast so I timed myself. Here are the results: </p>

        <p>So I cut three shallots in ~45min which is too slow. Also some shallot pieces were larger than others. <br>
            I need to practice slicing the shallots into 1/8 inch cubes until it becomes second-nature. </p>

        <p>Oblique cuts on carrots are easier for me. I cut 5 of these in under 15min which is not too bad but I can improve. <br>
            I'm making the cuts in a 45 degree angle. I want to play around with different angles next time.</p>
