    <h3>On Mathematics</h3>

    <p>
        I can go on for hours about mathematics. I will come back to this page when I have more time but there are some important points I want to expand on:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Mathematics is not calculation, it is engaging with ideas. That's a lot more fun.
        </li>

        <li>
            A lot about mathematics is having the right interpretation of symbols. Numbers themselves are symbols. Symbols represent abstract ideas.
        </li>

        <li>
            Mathematics does not depend on our senses. It strikes deep into A Priori truths!
        </li>

        <li>
            There are different types of infinities? <em>(I don't completely agree)</em>
        </li>

        <li>
            What are the benefits to learning mathematics?
        </li>
    </ul>
